## Implementing web scraping in python using BeautifulSoup

*Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and more readable manner.*

## Steps to be followed
- Installing the required third-party libraries
- Request the content (source code) of a specific URL from the server
- Download the content that is returned
- Identify the elements of the page that are part of the table we want
- Extract and (if necessary) reformat those elements into a dataset we can analyze or use in whatever way we require.
